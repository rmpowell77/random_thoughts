# Power Shell 

I've been doing some cross compiling for [CalChart](https://github.com/calband/calchart) and I had to use powershell.  Running general commands I see that the lines get truncated with ... when they are too long.  And from some brief searching it looks like it's not possible to change that.  I'm not sure if I'm searching right, but it doesn't seem like PowerShell is that useful... Weird, huh?  Maybe I'll figure it out some day.
